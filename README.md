This project makes heavy use of variables in order to control the colors of the buildings. This was my first introduction to using variables. At this point, I feel I have a basic understanding of how to use variables with css.

As a sidenote - if you resize the image to width > 1000px, it changes from daytime to night time. Awesome!
